    <p>Top-level catalog for tests provided by
    Steven Pemberton in December 2021.</p>
    <p>There are two sub-groups, one general
    and one focused on syntax issues.</p>
  </description>

  <!--* The syntaxtests catalogs assume that you have
      * unzipped SP-syntaxtests-package.zip in this
      * directory; you may also have unzipped
      * syntaxtests.zip. No harm is done by unzipping
      * both.
      *-->
  <!--* The three syntaxtests catalogs use the
      * same test cases but test them in slightly
      * different ways.  You may want all three,
      * or only one or two, depending on the processor
      * you are testing.

  <!--* The tests-SP-MSM tests do not require any unzipping.
      * They are, as Erica Jong might say, zipless tests.
