This directory contains a version of Steven Pemberton's tests.zip
file, modified by Michael Sperberg-McQueen and packaged with a test
catalog using the test-catalog vocabulary defined in MSM's ixml-tests
repository.

Note that a large number of tests have been changed vis-a-vis
tests.zip.  In many cases this only involved removing non-grammatical
whitespace from the end of the input, but in other cases larger
interventions were made.  The details are in the catalog.
